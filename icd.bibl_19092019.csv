Apart from the obvious  speedup in computation time, there is no need for communication between the processors involved  in the computation. Furthermore, because a significantly reduced number of matrix vector  multiplications is needed per initial vector, parallel filter diagonalization is numerically more  stable than the single processor approach.

The mechanism of the decay, which does not occur  in the isolated monomer units constituting the clusters has recently been shown to be of  intermolecular/interatomic nature. This intermolecular/interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD)  mechanism prevails in many systems ranging from hydrogen-bonded molecular clusters to atomic  rare gas clusters. In the present paper we extend our previous studies to weakly bound  heteroclusters built up of monomer units of largely differing energetics. It is shown that,  as soon as the double ionization potential of a monomer unit is lower in energy than the  ionization potential of the initially created inner-valence vacancy on a neighboring monomer  unit, an additional electronic decay process can take place. In contrast to the ICD mechanism,  which involves an efficient energy transfer between the monomer units, this second process is  essentially based on an electron transfer process. It is therefore termed electron-transfer  mediated decay (ETMD). We have analyzed the mechanisms of the electronic decay processes  taking place following inner-valence ionization in weakly bound heteroclusters in an exemplary  study of the NeAr dimer. The involved electronic states have been calculated using <em>ab initio</em>  Green's function techniques. The lifetime of the inner-valence Ne(2<em>s</em><sup>-1</sup>)Ar vacancy has been  estimated and partitioned according to the contributions of the two decay channels based on  a perturbation-theoretical description of the decay process. As a result, the lifetime of the  inner-valence resonance state is estimated to be of the order of 10-100 fs, the specific  value strongly depending on the internuclear separation of the monomers. The ICD process is  shown to be by far the dominant decay channel at distances corresponding to bound states of  the dimer. With decreasing internuclear separation the ratio of the ETMD and ICD decay widths  quickly increases over several orders of magnitude. ","","","",""

In our calculations we consider the discontinuity of the effective mass  of the electron in each of the QW layers. We control the ICD lifetime by changing the distance between the two wells.  The expected overall trend is a decrease of ICD lifetime with a decrease in the distance between the wells. We show  that the distance can be tuned such that the emitted ICD electron is trapped in a metastable state in the con-tinuum,  i.e., a one-electron resonance state. This causes the lifetime of the ICD to be an order of magnitude smaller even at  very long distances, and improves the efficiency of the ICD process. For the ICD to be the dominant decay mechanism  it must prevail over all other possible competitive decay processes. We have found that the lifetime of the ICD is on  the time scale of picoseconds.

To  identify favorable criteria for such synergies in a qualitative and quantitative manner, we conducted a  considerable amount of simulations scanning multiple geometrical parameters. The focus of the paper is not only  to find the geometries which are most favorable to ICEC but most importantly to explain the basic principles of  the ICEC probability. We have thus derived a number of energy relations among solely single-electron level  energies that explain the mechanisms of the multiple reaction pathways. Among them are direct ICEC, both  slowing or accelerating the outgoing electron, as well as resonance-enhanced ICEC which captures into a  two-electron resonance state that decays thereafter. These pathways may apply simultaneously for just one  single geometric configuration and contribute constructively leading to an enhancement of the reaction  probability.

The creation of ICD-active states requires the production of highly excited systems, usually populated by  innershell ionization or excitation. To this end, XUV and X-ray radiation from synchrotrons was conventionally applied  for the majority of experiments due to the desired state-selective ionization of certain sub-shells. The advent of  Free-Electron Lasers (FELs) has enabled an entirely new class of experiments, which finally allow to trace ICD directly  in the time domain due to the femtosecond pulse duration. Within this paper, the first time-resolved ICD measurement  using an XUV-pump-XUV-probe scheme will be discussed in detail. The experiment was performed on neon dimers and ICD was  triggered by removing a 2<em>s</em> electron from one of the neon atoms using a 58 eV pulse from the FEL in Hamburg  (FLASH). The onset of ICD was probed with a delayed copy of the trigger pulse that further ionized one of the two  Ne<sup>+</sup> ions emerging after ICD.

As ICD  occurs, the excitation energy is released by transferring it to an atomic or molecular neighbor of the initially  excited particle. As a consequence the neighboring atom or molecule is ionized as it receives the energy. A few years  later the existence of ICD was confirmed experimentally (Marburger <em>et al</em> 2003 <em>Phys.

It was even demonstrated, that ICD can become more efficient than a local Auger decay  in some system. This review will concentrate on recent experimental investigations on ICD. It will briefly introduce  the phenomenon and give a short summary of the 'early years' of ICD (a detailed view on this episode of investigations  can be found in the review article by U Hergenhahn with the same title (Hergenhahn 2011 <em>J.

The processes are  initiated by core-electron ionization of a solute molecule and involve proton transfer along the solute-solvent  hydrogen bond. As a result, short-lived singly charged cations form with structures sharing a proton between solute  and solvent molecules. These molecular transients decay by autoionization, which creates reactive dicationic species  with the positive charges delocalized over the entire molecular entity. Here, we investigate the ultrafast electron  and nuclear dynamics following the core ionization of hydrated ammonia and glycine. Both molecules serve as models  for exploring the possible role of the nonlocal relaxation processes in the chemical reactivity at the interface  between, for instance, a protein surface and aqueous solution. The nature of the postionization dynamical processes  is revealed by high-accuracy Auger-electron spectroscopy measurements on liquid microjets in vacuum. The  proton-transfer-mediated processes are identified by electron signals in the high-energy tail of the Auger spectra  with no analogue in the Auger spectra of the corresponding gas-phase molecule. This high-energy tail is suppressed for  deuterated molecules. Such an isotope effect is found to be smaller for aqueous ammonia as compared to the  hydrated H<sub>2</sub>O molecule, wherein hydrogen bonds are strong. An even weaker hydrogen bonding for the hydrated  amino groups in glycine results in a negligibly small proton transfer. The dynamical processes and species formed upon  the nitrogen-1s core-level ionization are interpreted using methods of quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics. With  the assistance of such calculations, we discuss the conditions for the proton-transfer-mediated relaxation processes  to occur. We also consider the solvent librational dynamics as an alternative intermolecular ultrafast relaxation  pathway. In addition, we provide experimental evidence for the umbrella-type motion in aqueous ammonia upon core  ionization. This intramolecular channel proceeds in parallel with intermolecular relaxation processes in the solution.","","","",""

We show that the emission yield of those low energy electrons increases dramatically in ion-atom collisions  depending on whether or not the target atoms are isolated or embedded in an environment. Only when the atom that  has been ionized and excited by the primary particle impact is in immediate proximity of another atom is a  fragmentation route known as interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD) enabled. This leads to the emission of a low  energy electron. Over the past decade ICD was explored in several experiments following photoionization. Most  recent results show its observation even in water clusters. Here we show the quantitative role of ICD for the  production of low energy electrons by ion impact, thus approaching a scenario closer to that of radiation damage  by alpha particles: We choose ion energies on the maximum of the Bragg peak where energy is most efficiently  deposited in tissue. We compare the electron production after colliding He<sup>+</sup> ions on isolated Ne atoms  and on Ne dimers (Ne<sub>2</sub>). In the latter case the Ne atom impacted is surrounded by a most simple  environment already opening ICD as a deexcitation channel.

Biol.",88,,"","871",2012,"","experiment","","","","","","","Taylor & Francis","","","","","","","<em>Purpose</em>: The paper gives an introduction into Interatomic and Intermolecular Coulombic Decay (ICD).  ICD is an autoionization process, which contrary to Auger decay involves neighbouring sites of the initial  vacancy as an integral part of the decay transition. As a result of ICD, slow electrons are produced which are  known to be active in radiation damage. The author summarizes the properties of ICD and reviews a number of  important experiments done in recent years.  <em>Materials and methods</em>: Intermolecular Coulombic Decay can generally take place in weakly bonded aggregates in  the presence of ionizing particles or ionizing radiation. Examples collected here mostly use soft X-rays produced  by synchrotron radiation to ionize, and use rare-gas clusters, water clusters or solutes in a liquid jet to  observe ICD after irradiation.  <em>Results</em>: Intermolecular Coulombic Decay is initiated by single ionization into an excited state. The subsequent  relaxation proceeds via an ultra-fast energy transfer to a neighbouring site, where a second ionization occurs.  Secondary electrons from ICD have clearly been identified in numerous systems. ICD can take place after primary  ionization, as the second step of a decay cascade which also involves Auger decay, or after resonant excitation  with an energy which exceeds the ionization potential of the system.  <em>Conclusions</em>: ICD is expected to play a role whenever particles or radiation with photon energies above the  ionization energies for inner valence electrons are present in weakly bonded matter, e.g. biological tissue.  The process produces at the same time a slow electron and two charged atomic or molecular fragments, which  will lead to structural changes around the ionized site.","","","",""

Electronic coupling to the environment, however, allows for alternative decays  resembling Intermolecular Coulombic Decay (ICD), producing final states with one of the holes  delocalized on a neighboring water molecule. Here we present an experimental study of such minority  processes, which adds to our understanding of dynamic interactions of electronically excited  H<sub>2</sub>O molecules with their local surrounding in liquid water and aqueous solution.  We show that the solvation of metal-halide salts considerably influences these minority decay  channels from the water O 1s<sup>-1</sup> state. By breaking water-water bonds, both the metal  cations and halide anions are found to reduce the decay into water-water delocalized states, thus  having a &ldquo;passive&rdquo; effect on the Auger spectrum. The halide anions also play an &ldquo;active&rdquo; role by  opening a new ICD-like decay pathway into water-halide delocalized states. The importance of this  contribution increases from F<sup>-</sup> to I<sup>-</sup>, which we suggest to be caused by a  directional polarization of the halide anion towards the core-ionized H<sub>2</sub>O<sup>+</sup>  cation in the intermediate state of the Auger process. This increases the electronic overlap between  the two centers and makes delocalized decays more probable. We furthermore show that F<sup>-</sup>,  the smallest and most strongly hydrated of the halides, plays an additional role as proton puller during the core-hole lifetime, resulting in proton dynamics on the low femtosecond time scale. Our  results represent a step forward toward a better understanding of how aqueous solutions, when  exposed to soft X-rays, channel excess energy. This has implications for several aspects of physical  and radiation chemistry, as well as biology.","","","",""

When multiple photons are absorbed in complex systems, a plasma-like state is formed  where many atoms are ionized on a femtosecond timescale. If multiphoton absorption is resonantly-enhanced, the system  becomes electronically-excited prior to plasma formation, with subsequent decay paths which have been scarcely  investigated to date. Here, we show using helium nanodroplets as an example that these systems can decay by a new type  of process, named collective autoionization. In addition, we show that this process is surprisingly efficient, leading  to ion abundances much greater than that of direct single-photon ionization.

Results obtained by several laboratories on films prepared and analyzed by  different methods and irradiated with different electron-beam current densities and fluencies are presented.

Unexpectedly, we find a similar propensity for proton dynamics to occur at both the carbon and oxygen site within the  lifetime of the core hole. Our results could serve as a model for decay processes that are likely to occur in other more  complex amphiphilic systems.","","","",""

In this study we investigate the  process of low-energy-electron production in Ar clusters by electron-ion multiple coincidence measurements. In  addition to photoelectrons, low-energy electrons are observed after 2<em>p</em> ionization of argon clusters. We  find that low-energy-electron production increases when the energy of photoelectrons exceeds the ionization  potential of Ar. We experimentally identify the low-energy electrons produced by interatomic electronic decay  processes and inelastic scattering of the photoelectrons and Auger electrons with the surrounding Ar atoms.","","","",""

Rev. A",99,,"","043414",2019,"","experiment","","","","","","","American Physical Society","","","","","","","We have conducted an experimental study on the photo double ionization (PDI) of carbon-dioxide dimers  at photon energies of 37 and 55 eV and oxygen dimers at photon energies of 38, 41.5, and 46 eV, while focusing on  the dissociation dynamics upon single-photon absorption. The investigation was performed by applying the  cold-target recoil-ion momentum spectroscopy method in order to collect and record the three-dimensional momenta of  the ionic fragments and emitted electrons from the dissociating dimer in coincidence. The kinetic-energy release  upon fragmentation and the electron angular distributions in the laboratory and body-fixed frames, as well as the  relative electron-electron emission angle, show unambiguous experimental evidence of intermolecular Coulombic  decay (ICD) in carbon-dioxide dimers upon photoionization below and above the double-ionization threshold of  CO<sub>2</sub> monomers. The PDI of oxygen dimers is less conclusive and shows contributions from ICD and  knock-off ionization mechanisms. As for atomic dimers, the present results reveal that ICD in CO<sub>2</sub> dimers after valence PDI can also serve as a source for low-energy electrons, known to be very relevant in  biological systems, cells, and tissues.","","","",""

Single and double ionization as well as single ionization accompanied by the release of a C<sub>2</sub> dimer were observed as a function of the photon energy for the positive parent ion and double detachment was measured  for the negative parent ion. The emphasis of the experiments was on the specific effects of the encapsulated trimetallic  nitride cluster Sc<sub>3</sub>N on the observed reactions. Clear evidence of photoexcitation near the Sc <em>L</em> edge is obtained with the dominating contributions visible in the one- and two-electron-removal channels.  <em>K</em>-vacancy production in the encapsulated central nitrogen atom is seen in the single ionization of  Sc<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub><sup>+</sup> but is much less pronounced in the photoionization-with-fragmentation channel.  Comparison of the cross sections near the carbon <em>K</em> edge with the corresponding channels measured previously in  the photoionization of Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub><sup>+</sup> reveal strong similarities. Previously predicted sharp  resonance features in the ionization of Sc<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub><sup>+</sup> ions below the Sc <em>M</em> edge are  not confirmed. The experiments are accompanied by quantum-chemistry calculations in the Hartree-Fock approximation and  by model calculations employing density functional theory (DFT).","","","",""
